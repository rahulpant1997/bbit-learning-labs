    "# Portfolio Learning Item\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now learn about the final representation and class in our portfolio manager, the portfolio. We've discussed how individuals or institutions can have multiple accounts for different purposes. A portfolio is a collection of these accounts, but also is any collection of investments/financial assets, including stock, bonds, derivatives, ETFs, etc. Accounts are technically a portfolio, but large firms will usually have multiple accounts with different trading strategies. The collection of these accounts represents their portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I could have account *Tech Strategy* which contains the positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "***2,000*** shares of ***MSFT USD***,\n",
    "***200*** shares of ***AAPL USD***, and \n",
    "***100*** shares of ***TSLA USD***\n",
    "\n",
    "And an account *Healthcare Strategy* which contains the positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1,000*** shares of ***UNH USD***,\n",
    "***200*** shares of ***HCA USD***, and \n",
    "***100*** shares of ***MSFT USD***\n",
    "\n",
    "My entire portfolio is the union of these two accounts. It's important to note that accounts within a portfolio don't need to be mutually exclusive in their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a class that allows for the management of a portfolio. We should be able to construct a portfolio using a set of accounts and a portfolio name. We should be able to query the portfolio object retrieving the name of the portfolio, a subset of accounts based on a set of account names or return a collection of all accounts. We should also be able to remove/add accounts based on a set of account names or account objects respectively. Removals should ignore non-existent names & additions can replace existing accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow for a portfolio to be created with a set of accounts and a portfolio name\n",
    "- Allow for querying of the current portfolio's name\n",
    "- Allow for querying of all accounts within the portfolio\n",
    "- Allow for the querying for accounts in the portfolio that match the filter criteria, returning an iterable\n",
    "    - The user can give a set of account names. Any accounts that match these names should be returned\n",
    "    - The user can give a set of security names or objects. Any accounts that contain positions which match the set should be returned\n",
    "    - The user can combine both queries creating a dual filter. Accounts that pass both filters should be returned.\n",
    "- Allow for accounts to be added to the portfolio with a set of account objects. Incoming accounts can replace existing accounts\n",
    "- Allow for the removal of accounts from the portfolio with a set of account names. Names not in the portfolio should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",

    "Your solution will need to follow the interface provided in the lab. Below is a snippet of the interface for securities that you can inherit from. The methods that will be tested are displayed & will need to be overwritten with your implementation. You're free to add more methods then what is displayed in the interface!\n",

    "#### *Testing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed & saved your solution you can run the test file to validate that your solution works as expected. For the test to run the following need to be true.\n",
    "- Saved code to file **implementations/portfolio_solution.py**\n",
    "- Create a class with the name **Portfolio** that inherits from **PortfolioInterface**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you complete your class & have a solution with valid tests try completing the following stretch goals \n",
    "\n",
    "- Update your class init to handle the account set being optional\n",
    "- Add custom implementation for class's __str__ method.\n",
    "- Add a method to remove clear the entire portfolio of all accounts\n",
    "- Develop tests for the new methods created"
