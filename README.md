# Learning Labs
[![Binder](https://badges.dev.bloomberg.com/badge/launch/binder/57a7ca?icon=binder)](https://binder.dev.bloomberg.com/v2/gh/bbit/learning_labs/main)

Get ready to learn! Bloomberg Learning Labs are a collection of activities designed to help candidates learn more about particular technologies and financial domain concepts, while demonstrating how we use computer science knowledge to solve problems in this domain.

## Rationale

Here at Bloomberg, we want to give candidates better insight into what software engineering looks like and how we build our software solutions. This repo contains a series of labs that will immerse and engage developers in creating solutions to problems we face at Bloomberg! Through these labs, you will learn more about our problem domain and continue to develop your coding skills.

## Quick Start

## Lab Navigation

When the [PortfolioManager folder](https://bbgithub.dev.bloomberg.com/bbit/learning_labs/tree/main/PortfolioManager) is clicked, you will see each learning unit from "0-Securities" to "5-Graphing".

## Framework

This lab follows a framework of learning items. Each learning item has a goal/objective for the developer to complete. Objectives can build on one another, thereby allowing the developer to use their previous code in new problem sets. Each learning item item has a set of **engineering provided data** and **developer provided solutions**.

### Lab Provided Data

- Problem Background/Jupyter Notebook
- Data Source
- Solution Interface
- Example Solution
- Testing File

#### *Problem Background/Jupyter Notebook*

The lab will include a Jupyter notebook which gives the developer context and a background into the problem. Furthermore, in each of the notebooks, there is a section to allow developers to write their solutions.

#### *Data Source*

Each lab will be set up to provide *generators* for any required data. This is all mock data, so feel free to update it as you see fit while working through the lab.

#### *Solution Interface*

For expected solutions, the lab will provide developers with an interface. The methods of this interface are what will be used in tests. They are expected in the class that you create.

#### *Example Solution*

If help is needed, or to compare what you developed against another implementation, example solutions are also provided. You should ideally try and write your solution first without consulting the example.

#### *Testing File*

Every piece of code needs a good test! To help validate that what you've developed matches the requirements, we've included test files. They focus on the expected use cases of a class, but can always be expanded if you'd like to increase your coverage. 

### Developer Provided Solution

- Problem Implementation
- Unit Tests
