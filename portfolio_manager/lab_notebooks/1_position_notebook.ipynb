    "# Positions Learning Item\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a position?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what a security is, the next logical entity in our position manager is positions! A position is the representation of how *much* of a particular security is owned by an individual or financial firm. Simply put, it lets you know how much Y you own.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could have a position like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "A position of ***2,000*** shares of ***MSFT USD***!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may think that all positions are positive numbers, but you can actually have positions that are negative, which represents that you \"own\" a negative amount of something. This is called a *short* position versus a positive position amount that is *long*. For the focus of this lab, we'll assume and expect that all positions are long. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a class that represents a position. We should be able to construct a position with a security object we created, as well as a seed or initial position. We may also want to create a position without constructing a security object by using the security name we'd like our position to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd expect the ability to get the security object the position represents along with the current position value. Lastly we'd want to be able to update the position value with the ability to add to the existing position & set the position value. If a position seed or update results in a short position we'd expect an error to be thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow for a position to be created with a security name or object and a seed position value\n",
    "- Allow for gathering of the position's security and position value\n",
    "- Allow for updating of the position's size via addition & setting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provided Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Data Source*\n",
    "\n",
    "No data is required for creating your position class but there is a data generator class *PositionUpdates* which can be used to generate a few random position updates for testing. On creation this class will generate a list of numerical values that will always be positive when iterating and adding. The class has three methods that can be used is_next_available(), get_next_transaction() and get_transaction_list(). Below is a snippet of the class and examples of how each method could be used in creating a test\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import our data generator\n",
    "from generators.position_data_generator import PositionUpdates\n",
    "pos_updater = PositionUpdates()\n",
    "\n",
    "#Check if there is an available position update\n",
    "if pos_updater.is_next_available()\n",
    "    # Get the current position update value\n",
    "    print(pos_updater.get_next_transaction())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Return the list of all positions update generated\n",
    "pos_list = pos_updater.get_transaction_list()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Solution Interface*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution will need to follow the interface provided in the lab. Below is a snippet of the interface for securities that you can inherit from. The methods that will be tested are displayed & will need to be overwritten with your implementation. You're free to add more methods then what is displayed in the interface!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#filename interfaces.position_interface.py\n",
    "#Position Class Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "from security_interface import SecurityInterface\n",
    "class PositionInterface():\n",
    "    def __init__(self, security, initial_position: int) -> None:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_security(self) -> SecurityInterface:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_position(self) -> int:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def set_position(self, input_value: int) -> None:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def add_position(self, input_value: int) -> None:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully import the interface into your solution cell you'll need to add the below code snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from interfaces.position_interface import PositionInterface\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Testing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed & saved your solution you can run the test file to validate that your solution works as expected. For the test to run the following need to be true.\n",
    "- Saved code to file **implementations/position_solution.py**\n",
    "- Create a class with the name **Position** that inherits from **PositionInterface**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you complete your class & have a solution with valid tests try completing the following stretch goals \n",
    "\n",
    "- Add custom implementation for class's __str__ method. The position print method shouldn't reimplement the security's print str method but should utilize it.\n",
    "- Develop a test for your new __str__ method."
