    "# Graphing & BQPlot\n",

    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with a few tools at our disposal with our python classes, let's introduce a visual component! We'll be using bqplot which is a Bloomberg graphical library for interactive GUIs. We'll cover the basics here but an extensive tutorial can be found at https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot! With bqplot we'd like to have the ability to plot our the market value of our various entities over time. To handle this for now we'll setup a simple loop which queries the MV of our entities. To start off try plotting out the market value of a single security within bqplot. The final goal of your plot should be the ability to graph a portfolios market value changes over time.  We can create a set of functions that generate data & interface with bqplot for reuse. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Plotter***\n",
    "- Create a method or class to plot the market value of a set of securities over time.\n",
    "    - Your class or method should take a variables for the amount of data to be generated (i.e give me a collection of security values of X size)\n",
    "    - Your graph output should have intractable data points. Clicking on a data point should print/log a string for the data point(i.e Security X was valued at Y during Z) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Provided Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Data Source*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this portion no additional data sources are given. You should modify your existing classes to allow for the desired functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Solution Interface*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this portion no additional interfaces are given. Your plotter solution should result \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Testing*\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing you can update your position, account & portfolio modules from the previous modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've completed the graphing the security market values over time, you can attempt to create a set of plotting solutions that allow for the graphs of positions, accounts & portfolios over time. Some of the suggested stretch goals are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you complete your class & have a solution with valid tests try completing the following stretch goals \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a method or class to plot the market value of a set of positions over time. Your solution show allow for drilling down into a particular position & seeing the position's security value over time.\n",
    "- Create a method or class to plot the market value of a set of accounts/Portfolio over time. Your solution show allow for drilling down into a particular account & seeing the accounts's position MVs over time."
